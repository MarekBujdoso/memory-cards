- What to do next

Done:
- Allow to check answer once a day
- Do not show cards already answered this day

Wanted functionality:
- See cards in order from higher level descending
- counting day - when all cards are answered or at least one?
- check the day is different and decide when to store the next day
- add nice message for "no more cards for today"
- add statistics to see how many learned and how many at which level
